## WHAT IS DOCKER?

Docker is a platform that allows you to run applications in isolated environments.

## WHAT IS A DOCKER CONTAINER AND IMAGE?

Containers are isolated processes that contain (no pun intended) all of the tools necessary to run an application.

## WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF DOCKER?

- Docker containers separate your application from the infrastructure so that you can deliver software quickly (running in production).
- Containers are lightway and contain everything you need to run an application so you don't need to be concerned with what is currently installed on the host.
- You can share the container image to ensure that everyone can run the same application. This helps standardize the environment for the application. No more worrying about if you have the right version of programminy languages installed and having to manage different version of programming languages
- This also makes the application very portable. You can run the application locally, on a physical or virtual machine in a data center, on the cloud, or a mixture of environments.
