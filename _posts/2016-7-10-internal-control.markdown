<p>In order to achieve a certain level of happiness, one must have internal control. Internal control is how you control your internal state (your thoughts and feelings). Often times we allow external circumstances to dictate our internal state, but external circumstances should only dictate our external state of life. How we feel and think about each and every experience of our life should be our own conscious choice and responsibility.</p>

<p>It is no scientific secret that our thoughts affect our emotions. We feel anxious when we believe there is a certain level of uncertainty in our life or when we do not feel that we are in control of what the future will bring. We feel sad when we have lost something of value. We feel mad or upset when someone has prevented us from achieving our goals and our desires. We feel pride when we attribute positive outcomes from our own actions. We feel gratitude when we attribute positive outcomes from the actions of others.</p>

<p>In order to take responsibility for our own happiness in life, we must choose how we interpret and respond to the external events that happen in our life. </p>

<p>Last year, I took a leadership class that changed the way I approached life. One of the first lessons I learned was to be more proactive instead of reactive with each event that occurred in my life. The premise is something like this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Generally, you react to each moment or event in your life.</li>
  <li>With each of these events, you tell yourself a "story" about what is going at that exact moment.</li>
  <li>How you interpret that event is within your power</li>
  <li>For example, if something bad happened to you, you can choose to interpret it has a lesson learned or you can play the victim card and wallow in self-pity. </li>
  <li>But the important thing to remember is that you are responsible for what you choose in life. And therefore, you are responsible for what you create in life.</li>
  <li>The key is to being proactive about how you respond to these events.</li>
</ul>
