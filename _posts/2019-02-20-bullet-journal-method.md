## INTRO

For a long time, I've had a difficult time tracking all the various goals that I wanted to accomplish in my life. I would use [insert random habit tracking app here] to keep track of habits and then use another random note taking software (like Evernote) to keep track of my progress of the same habits. This was not very efficient since the apps would pile up the data collected would be spread across these apps. Another issue I've always had was that I would write important ideas or thoughts on random notes and then lose or misplace those notes. It was frustrating to not have a “single source of truth” where I stored all of this important “life” data that I needed to keep track of. Then one day I came across a video about “Bullet Journaling,” a method that helps you keep track of your goals, thoughts, and life events all in one place.  It was an analog solution, so the barrier to entry was low since the only two things needed were a pen and notebook. It turned out to be a great solution for me and since then I've been practicing for a few years. But one day, I serendipitously found out that the creator of the Bullet Journal method wrote a book about the method, so I decided to read it with the hopes of improving my journaling technique. After finishing the book, I've not only formed a better habit of journaling, but have been able to better manage my time, consistently  accomplish tasks that I usually would put off (like writing this post!), and have been more mindful of the future. It was an easy read with a lot of ROI, so I am going to make some effort on this review.

## THE METHOD

This book is about the Bullet Journal method, a journaling technique created by Ryder Carroll. It is about both the methodology and philosophy behind the system. You may have seen examples of Bullet Journaling by coming across tutorials on Youtube of designers showing off their creative designs and custom pages for their own journals. If you search the #bulletjournal hash tag on Instagram, you'll see hundreds of pictures of people posting some really creative ideas and designs on everything from custom lists of what movies they watched to tracking habits they are trying to acquire. At it's core, Bullet Journaling is an analog solution for organizing things you want to get done. It turns any regular notebook or journal into a to-do list, planner, diary, and calendar all-in-one.  This helps facilitate the philosophy behind the method which is generally how to be more productive, mindful, and intentional about your life.  It equips you with a method that helps you become more mindful of how you use your two most valuable resources: your time and energy. With more time and energy, you can spend those resources to discovering what you are naturally curious about and what you find meaningful in life. Whether it be finding more time working on your craft, or spending more time with your loved ones, the method helps zero in on what is most important to you and helps you break up the steps necessary to get there. With habitual introspection and review, you make deliberate decisions everyday of how you will spend your time and energy.

## PROS / CONS

What I liked:

* This Bullet Journal method is an analog solution that provides the offline space for you to process, to think, and to focus. There was always something about writing in a journal that was therapeutic for me. Even the author cites that the act of writing draws our mind to the present moment, which is sometimes what we need to simply unplug from everything that is wanting our attention.
* The author created the method as a result of having trouble focusing as a child. This really resonated with me because I always felt that I've had a difficult time focusing and completing important tasks, so knowing I was learning a system designed for people who have trouble accomplishing tasks made feel that I could trust this system even more. 
* It is a simple method that anyone can learn in 5 minutes but vastly benefit from for the rest of their lives. It helps you distill what is important in your life by following a system that asks you to evaluate your goals on a daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly basis.  Re-evaluating each goal on your list forces you to think about its significance and why you are doing it. Another aspect of the technique also focuses on breaking down each goal into smaller, more manageable tasks so you have a easier time of completing them.
* The method has an easy structure to follow, extend, and modify for one's needs. All you need is a notebook and a pen to get started. 
* There is a huge community of Bullet Journalists. The author recognizes that Bullet Journaling has been more popular in social media as of late due to the creative community. Find any #bulletjournal hashtag on social media and you will come across creative designs for lists and some of the most beautiful calligraphy ever written.


What others might not like:

* The philosophy aspect of the book can be received as a “self-help” tone. It may not jive with everyone.
* In a digital age, using an analog method may not be for everyone. Constantly writing everything down may not be everyone's cup of tea. 

## ANALYSIS ( AND KEY TAKEAWAYS )

* The Bullet Journal allows you to examine your life with greater clarity by putting all the things that are important in your life in one place. It is designed to be your source of truth; you no longer have to worry about where your thoughts live. Once you've learned how to keep your thoughts in one place, you examine how to prioritize them effectively. From there, you form regular habit of introspection where you'll begin to define what's important, why it is important, and how to pursue those things
* It is a method that weaves productivity, mindfulness, and intentionality into a framework that is flexible, forgiving, and most importantly, practical.
* The philosophy of the Bullet Journal method comes down to mindfulness and awareness. It is designed so that you become more aware of where you are, who you are, and what you want.  It keeps us mindful of why we are doing what we are doing and thus reinforces our motivation for completing the tasks we have created ourselves.

## CONCLUSION

I highly recommend this book for anyone looking for a system to help organize what you want in life. If you have struggled with keeping track of your goals in the past and/or haven't found a system that you consistently use, the Bullet Journal method is a good place to start. I believe that anyone can really benefit from the technique itself without having to dive too much into the philosophy, but the I believe the philosophy serves as a great compliment to the technique.  In the beginning, I watched the video a few times to understand the system. The basics I learned from the video did help me get started with casual journaling, but studying the philosophy behind the method and discovering a few additional techniques from the book really catapulted my commitment to forming a daily habit of journaling and introspection. Overall, this was a great read and I hope you will gain from it as much as I did.
