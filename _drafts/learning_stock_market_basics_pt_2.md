# How to read a balance sheet

# Take aways from the book

- Ignore the gurus, they don't know anymore than what anyone else knows
- Beware of forecasts that come from analysts and gurus. They're intended to sell a product and that makreting usually involves fear. Nothing gets attention better than a panic-inducing outlook.
- The market always fluctuates
- The money you invest in stocks shouldn't be the money you need for groceries next month or college tuition next year
- The market freaks out from time to time
