<h1>What is RESTful architecture?</h1>

<p>When I first started learning about the web, I would often hear about the term "REST" and "RESTFul APIs."</p>

<em>"Yet another complicated acronym term I have to learn."</em> followed by a ::simultaneous UGH & SIGH::

<p>But as I studied more about the web, I realized it is a pretty important concept to (try to) understand. You see, the web is basically a giant network of computers that exchange information with each other. How they access, retrieve, and represent this information from one another was once equivalent to the wild west. Some smart dudes at the W3C decided to try to figure out a solution, and that solution was an architectural pattern known as REST.</p>
