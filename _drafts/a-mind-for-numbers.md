This book is the book I wish I had read during my time at UCSD. I was a biology major
and loved all my classes related to biology as it was easy to study things that interested in me. However, I did have to take 3 courses, in chemistry, physics, organic chemistry, and calculus, all of which I could not appreciate when I took those courses. A Mind For Numbers was written to teach you how to learn hard topics (or anything really). I apply the techniques from that book everyday at work and it has helped me greatly learn and retain more than I ever could ever imagined. You see, there is an actual science to studying better, and the book breaks it down chapter by chapter. But I felt like these were the main takeaways from the book:

- Test yourself after studying
- Spaced repetition
- Review after you have studied
- The Einstellung Effect
- Two mental modes of operation

Problems to address:

- 

## The Einstellung Effect

The Einstellung Effect is when you are so focused on a problem that your attention is unable to shift away to consider better alternatives.

Bonus: UCSD has an online course taught by professor Oakley called learning how to learn https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn
