It was the day that Kobe Bryant would play his last game. The Lakers would play
Utah Jazz at home and Kobe would be suiting up for the last time. Although the
Jazz were not a great team nor were they in the playoffs, they still were a
young team that had consistently beat the current squad of Lakers for the past
few seasons. I assumed that the game plan for the Lakers was to simply pass to
Kobe so he could jackup as many baskets as he could, but never did I expect
him to score 60 and make the last few game winning shots. He brought the Lakers
back from down 20.

Watching Kobe made me think about what it takes to be great at anything.
He is undeniably one of the hardest working athletes in all of sports.
But what also drives him
