# Learning The Basics

With the stock market being so much in the media, I finally took it upon myself to learn a little bit more about investing in the stock market. Because of the current state of the economy as portrayed by the media, I believe that the stock market should go down in general as a whole, and if the stock market is down, there might be an opportunity to buy stocks for a low price. However, I realized that I don't really know anything about investing in the stock market in general. I don't know how to determine if one stock is a better buy than the other. Should I buy Shopify stock that is currently going for $700 something bucks or the Carnival Cruise stock that looks like it keeps going lower and lower? Because I don't have any of the answers, I decided it was time to do some studying. 

The resource I am going to use is a book called "The Neastest Little Guide to Stock Market Investing." The book is more than 10 years old so the information it has on modern companies might be a little oudated, but the principles of investing should be the same nonetheless. With these principles in mind, I will apply them to GoDaddy stock to determine if GoDaddy stock is a good buy.

## Fundamental Analysis vs Technical Analysis

There are two ways to evaluate a stock: through fundamental analysis and technical analysis. Fundamental analysis examines the company's health and potential to success. You yuse this infomration to learn about the company. The second way is using technical analysis, which examines the past behavior of the stock in different market conditions and attempts to predict the stock's future price based on current market conditions and trading volume.
For the individual investor, fundamental analysis should form the core of their evaluations. Knowing and using fundamental analysis makes sense because it analyzes a company's health, and healthy companies are the companies that make the best long-term investments. Some metrics of fundamental analysis include the company's management, rate of growth, how much it earns, and how much it pays to keep the lights on. 

## Fundamental Stock Measurements

There are a lot of important measurements but the author aims to talk about 9 of them using GoDaddy stock (ticker: GDDY) as an example:

### Cash Flow Per Share

You generally want to invest in a company that has positive cash flow. Cash flow can reveal a lot about a company. There can be profitable companies that don't have strong cash flows because they sell their goods on credit. For example, mattress companies that sell you a mattress where you don't make payments for the first year. Cash flow per share is simply a company's cash flow divided by the number of shares outstanding. This lets you see what price you are paying for a share of the company's cash flow. As of April 2020, GoDaddy's Cash Flow Per Share is $18.36.

### Dividend Yield

A stock's dividend yield is the amount of dividends paid out by a company annually divided by current price of the stock. 

### Current Ratio

The current ratio is a way to guage a company's ability to pay its short term bills. Its a pretty simple ratio. Take all of the company's current assets and divide that by current liabilities. If it is greater than one, then you know the company has more assets than liabilities. If less than one, then liabilities are greater. It is a quick way to get a view of how the company is doing. If the quick ratio is less than 1, this might be indicative of too much debt, which is bad for the company. 

### Price Book Ratio

The Price Book ratio compares a stock's price to how much the stock is worth right now if someone liquidated the company. It is calculated by common stockholders' equity divided by outstanding shared. As of April 2020, GoDaddy has a P/B ratio of $17.73. That means if the company liquidated all of its assets today, it would not be able to pay you the $17.73/share it owes you.

### Return on Equity

Return on equity shows you the rate of return to shareholdrs by dividing net income by total shareholders equity. Bigger is always better with this number because it means the company is making a lot of money off the investments that shareholders have made. A good return on equity is anything above 20 percent. 

### Price/Sales

In the book, research done by an investor named James O'Shaughnessy (author of the book What Works on Wall Street) found that the two best value measures for stocks are Price/Sales for companies of all sizes and dividend yield for large companies.

## Growth Investing vs Value Investing

### Value Measurements

The best all-purpose value measure is price-to-sales. Divident yield is a great value measure against large, market-leading companies. The simplest and one of the best value strategies is to buy large, market-leading companies with high-divident yields. 


### Growth Measurements

The best growth measure is relative strength. Specifically: stocks with high relative price strengths. Avoid last year's biggest losers. Over the previous five years among all stocks, look for laggards because they're probably about to recover. The best growth strategy is to buy companies that have:
- A market cap greater than an inflation-adjusted $200
- A price-to-sales ratio below 1.5
- Earnings higher than the previous year
- A three-month price appreciation greater than the average
- A six-month price appreciation greater than the average
- The highest one-year price appreciation
- Relative price strength looks at a stock's price history.
