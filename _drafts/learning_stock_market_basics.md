# Learning The Basics

## Growth Investing vs Value Investing

## Fundamental Analysis vs Technical Analysis

There are two ways to evaluate a stock: through fundamental analysis and technical analysis. Fundamental analysis examines the company's health and potential to success. You yuse this infomration to learn about the company. The second way is using technical analysis, which examines the past behavior of the stock in different market conditions and attempts to predict the stock's future price based on current market conditions and trading volume.
For the individual investor, fundamental analysis should form the core of their evaluations. Knowing and using fundamental analysis makes sense because it analyzes a company's health, and healthy companies are the companies that make the best long-term investments. Some metrics of fundamental analysis include the company's management, rate of growth, how much it earns, and how much it pays to keep the lights on. 

## Fundamental Stock Measurements

There are a lot of important measurements but the author aims to talk about 9 of them using GoDaddy stock (ticker: GDDY) as an example:

### Cash Flow Per Share

You generally want to invest in a company that has positive cash flow. Cash flow can reveal a lot about a company. There can be profitable companies
that don't have strong cash flows because they sell their goods on credit. For example, mattress companies that sell you a mattress where you don't 
make payments for the first year. Cash flow per share is simply a company's cahs flow divided by the number of shares outstanding. This lets you see what
price you are paying for a share of the company's cash flow. As of April 2020, GoDaddy's Cash Flow Per Share is $18.36

### Dividend Yield

A stock's dividend yield is the amount of dividends paid out by a company annually divided by current price of the stock. 

### Current Ratio

### Price Book Ratio

The Price Book ratio compares a stock's price to how much the stock is worth right now if someone liquidated the company. It is calculated by common stockholders' equity divided by outstanding shared. As of April 2020, GoDaddy has a P/B ratio of $17.73. That means if the company liquidated all of its assets today, it would not be able to pay you the $17.73/share it owes you.

### Return on Equity

Return on equity shows you the rate of return to shareholdrs by dividing net income by total shareholders equity. Bigger is always better with this number because it means the company is making a lot of money off the investments that shareholders have made. A good return on equity is anything above 20 percent.
